  <h2 id="samurai" align="left">What makes a superhero?</h2> 
   A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn't. So in order to
   be a superhero, <strong> you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</strong>, and you need 
    to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.

    <p>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be  just a regular police story or detective story or human-interes story. But if it's 
        a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy , it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a 
        normal human being couldn't do, couldn't accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.  </p>
